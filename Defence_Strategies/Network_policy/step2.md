- **Complexity**: Starting with Kubernetes network policies is usually recommended. If your needs are simple, this might be enough.

- **Features**: If you require advanced features like encryption, layer 7 policies (based on HTTP etc.), or complex visualization, a CNI plugin might be a better fit.

- **Performance**: Some CNI plugins use eBPF, providing the potential for better performance in heavily loaded clusters.

#### Important Considerations

- **Planning**: Before you start creating rules, carefully map out your desired segments and traffic flows.

- **Pod Labeling**: Consistent labeling is essential for effective policy enforcement.

- **Gradual Rollout**: Start with simple policies and gradually add more complexity. Thoroughly test policies before deploying broadly to minimize disruptions.

- **Tooling**: Consider tools like Calico's visualization or network policy editors to streamline management, especially in complex environments.
