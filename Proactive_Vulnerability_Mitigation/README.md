#### Secret Management

 Kubernetes Secrets are objects designed to store sensitive information in a more secure manner than storing the data directly in Pod definitions or container images

- Enhanced Security
- Improved Configuration Management
- Flexibility
- Auditability

#### Enhanced Secret Management

For enhanced security, consider using external secrets providers like Hashicorp Vault or cloud-based secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.). These provide additional security features and management capabilities.

#### Container Sandboxing 

Sandbox creates an isolated environment within a Kubernetes cluster where you can run potentially untrusted or experimental code without risking the stability or security of other applications in the cluster. Think of it as a 'playground' within your Kubernetes environment.
