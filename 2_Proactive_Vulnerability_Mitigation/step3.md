Trivy is an open-source vulnerability scanner for containers and other artifacts. It's commonly used in the context of Docker to scan container images for vulnerabilities. 

#### Install trivy cli

```bash
wget https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/releases/download/v0.18.3/trivy_0.18.3_Linux-64bit.deb
sudo dpkg -i trivy_0.18.3_Linux-64bit.deb
```{{exec}}

##### Scan Dockerfiles

Scan the first dockerfile

```bash
docker pull nginx
```{{exec}}

Trivy will analyze Dockerfile and provide a report detailing any vulnerabilities found, including their severity levels and identifiers.

Scan the fixed dockerfile

```bash
trivy image nginx
```{{exec}}

In the last section, we will see how to integrate trivy with CI.
