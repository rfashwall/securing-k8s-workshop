#### Trivy

Trivy is an open-source vulnerability scanner for containers and other artifacts. It's commonly used in the context of Docker to scan container images for vulnerabilities. 

##### Install trivy cli

```
apt install trivy
```{{exec}}

##### Scan Dockerfiles

Scan the first dockerfile

```
trivy config 01.Dockerfile
```{{exec}}

Trivy will analyze Dockerfile and provide a report detailing any vulnerabilities found, including their severity levels and identifiers.

Scan the fixed dockerfile

```
trivy config 02.Dockerfile
```{{exec}}

In the last section, we will see how to integrate trivy with CI.
